# Cubit Mesh

## Geometry

We construct the geometry for the vertical cross section using 2D primitives available in Cubit.

Add diagram of Cubit geometry, labeling entities with names used in the Journal files.

## Meshing using Journal Scripts

We use Cubit journal files `mesh_tri.jou`  and `mesh_quad.jou` to generate triangular and quadrilateral meshes, respectively.
Both of these journal files make use of the `geometry.jou` and `createbc.jou` files for creating the geometry and tagging boundary conditions.
We use the Cubit graphical user interface to play the Journal files.

:::{important}
We use IDless journaling in Cubit.
This allows us to reference objects in a manner that should be independent of the version of Cubit that is being used.
In the journal files, the original command used is typically commented out, and the following command is the equivalent IDless command.
:::

Once you have run either the `mesh_tri.jou` or `mesh_quad.jou` journal file to construct the geometry and generate the mesh, you will have a corresponding Exodus-II file (`mesh_tri.exo` or `mesh_quad.exo`).
These are NetCDF files, and they can be loaded into ParaView.

After running the Python script in Cubit, you will have a corresponding Exodus-II file (`mesh_tri.exo` or `mesh_quad.exo`).
