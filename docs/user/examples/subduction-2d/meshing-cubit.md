# Cubit Mesh

## Geometry

We construct the geometry following the same general procedure that we used with Gmsh.
We first create points, then connect the points into curves, and finally connect the curves into surfaces.
{numref}`fig:example:subduction:2d:geometry:cubit` shows the geometry and variables names of the vertices and curves.

Geometry created in Cubit for generating the finite-element mesh.
The names of the verties and curves match the ones we use in the Cubit journal files.

## Meshing using Python script

We use the Python script `generate_cubit.py` to generate the mesh.
The Python script is setup so that it can be run from within Cubit or as a standalone Python script without the Cubit GUI interface.
In this example, we will run the script from within Cubit using the Journal editor.

:::{warning}
In this example we do not use IDless journaling in Cubit.
The ids of some of the geometric entities _might_ be depend on which version of Cubit you are using.
The differences are most likely to occur when we split curves.
For example, the section of the curve labeled `c_topo` might be labeled `c_topo@A` in your version with similar permutations for other curve sections.
:::

Once you have run the Python script to construct the geometry and generate the mesh, you will have a Exodus-II file (`mesh_tri.exo`).
These are NetCDF files, and they can be loaded into ParaView.
This can be done by either running ParaView and loading the file, or using the script provided in the viz directory.
For example, if ParaView is in your path, you can run the
following command:

```{code-block} console
---
caption: Start paraview and run the `viz/plot_mesh.py` Python script to view the mesh with triangular cells.
---
paraview --script=viz/plot_mesh.py
```
