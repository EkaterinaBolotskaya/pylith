# Suggested Exercises

1. Increase the contrast in the shear modulus across the fault. How does this affect the solution?
2. Create `.cfg` files to run Steps 2 and 3 with a Cubit mesh.
3. Use uniform refinement with 2 and 3 levels of refinement. How does this affect the resulting stress and strain field?
4. Change Step 3 to include multiple ruptures at different time intervals, while still accounting for the accumulated slip deficit.
5. Change the distribution and number of fake GNSS stations in Steps 4 and 5. How does this affect the inversion results?
6. Change the distribution of slip in Step 4. How does this affect the inversion results?
7. Create Cubit Journal files that build up the geometry from points and curves, analogous to the Gmsh Python script.
8. Create a Gmsh Python script that generates the geometry from a cross-section of a 3D block, analogous to the provided Cubit Journal files.
