# Cubit Mesh

## Geometry

We construct the geometry by taking a horizontal cross-section of a 3D block.
Alternatively, we could have constructed the geometry by building it up from points and curves like we did with Gmsh.
{numref}`fig:example:reverse:2d:geometry:cubit` shows the geometry and variables names of the vertices and curves.

Geometry created in Cubit for generating the finite-element mesh.
The names of the verties and curves match the ones we use in the Cubit journal files.

## Meshing using Python Script

We use the Python script `generate_cubit.py` to generate the mesh.
The Python script is setup so that it can be run from within Cubit or as a standalone Python script without the Cubit GUI interface.
In this example, we will run the script from within Cubit using the Journal editor.

Open the Python script `generate_cubit.py` in the Cubit journal editor.
Play the selected script or play the lines, making sure you play the first line so that Cubit uses the Python interpreter when running the script.
We specify the parameters controlling the geometry, mesh size, and cell shape near the top of the script.

We create a brick, extracting a midsurface from it, and then splitting the remaining surface with an extended fault and a splay surface.
We assign names to the surfaces, curves, and important vertices that we use when we specify the mesh sizing information and defining blocks and nodesets.

We use IDless journaling in CUBIT.
This allows us to reference objects in a manner that should be independent of the version of Cubit that is being used.
In the Python script the original command used is typically commented out, and the following command is the equivalent IDless command.

In addition to providing nodesets for the fault and splay, it is also important to provide nodesets defining the buried edges of these two surfaces.
In 2D this consists of a single vertex for each surface.
This information is required by PyLith to form the corresponding cohesive cells defining fault surfaces.
:::

:::{note}
Examine how we set the discretization size in Gmsh and Cubit.
In both cases the discretization size increases at a geometric rate with distance from the main fault.
For this simple geometry, it required less than 10 lines of Python code in Gmsh but significantly more lines in Cubit.
In Gmsh the code is very general and remains the same even as the domain geometry becomes more complex, whereas in Cubit the number of commands increases quickly as the geometry becomes more complex.

Once you have run the Python script to construct the geometry and generate the mesh, you will have a corresponding Exodus-II file (`mesh_tri.exo` or `mesh_quad.exo`).
These are NetCDF files, and they can be loaded into ParaView.
This can be done by either running ParaView and loading the file, or using the script provided in the viz directory.
For example, if ParaView is in your path, you can run the
following command:

```{code-block} console
---
caption: Start paraview and run the `viz/plot_mesh.py` Python script to view the mesh with triangular cells.
---
paraview --script=viz/plot_mesh.py
```

To load the mesh with quadrilateral cells, open the Python Shell in ParaView and set the `EXODUS_FILE` variable, and then run the `viz/plot_mesh.py` Python script.
See {ref}`sec-paraview-python-scripts` for more information about running ParaView Python scripts.

```{code-block} python

caption: Load a different Exodus file generated by Cubit by setting the `EXODUS_FILE` variable in the ParaView Python Shell.
---
EXODUS_FILE = "mesh_quad.exo"
```
